# Image-Classification-ML-DL

### Subject

This graduation thesis was completed with a lot of reasearch, development and effort. The goal was detection of lung diseases with both machine and deep learning models. For deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks were used to achieve the desired classficiation job. 

### Dataset

The dataset that was used is COVID-19 Radiography Database is provided in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database/code
The distribution of the dataset was shown in the following graph.

### Implementation

To implement this project, Python was used with many libraries with Tensorflow and Keras. CNN main steps were shown in the figure below.

There were four approaches to classify mammographic images. Each one is performed by using the most appropriate algorithms and implementation configurations. Necessary research and fine-tuning operations were done properly to enhance the system's performance. The four approaches were listed below in a figure.
